<h2>Password Cracking 101</h2>
	      
<h7>John the Ripper is known as the go to password cracking program. It's free and comes standard with Kali Linux.
However it is not a point and click use application. All commands must be run through the command prompt. As an example, 
	we will crack the default password that comes with kali, which is "toor," or root backwards.<br><br></h7>
	      
<img src="/pen-test-basics/pass01.png"><br><br>	      

<code>cp /etc/passwd/ passwd</code><br>
<code>cp /etc/shadow /shadow</code><br>
<code>unshadow passwd shadow > crack_file</code>	      
	      
<h7>The output file can named whatever you want, it doesn't have to be crack_file. It can be any output, but remember 
	      you will need to type it into the command prompt, more than once, so you may want to come up with something 
	      simple, or an abbreviation.</h7><br><br>	      

<img src="/pen-test-basics/pass02.png"><br><br>

<h7>Basically, John the ripper takes the hashed passwords file, which contains the system's password, and then "decodes" it 
	with the shadow file, which was used to obfuscate the password. John the Ripper is also capable of comparing the results with
	      any list of known or commonly use passwords, such as the infamous 'Rock You' password list. However, there are so many passwords
	      in this list, that I've often found this can actually slow down the process. It's best to check the list John has included or set by default first. Trust me, 
	I once spent 36 hours cracking a password with the rock you list, then cracked the same password in an hour an a half with the default list. </h7><br><br>	      

<code>john crack_file</code><br><br>
	      
<img src="/pen-test-basics/pass04.png"><br><br>	
<h7>Finally, as you can see here, the output of the crack_file was: root:toor:0:0:/root:/bin/bash. The output can be viewed 
	with the following command:</h7><br><br>
	
<code>john --show crack_file</code><br><br>	
	
<h7>The default kali linux user name is root, followed by the second bit, ‘toor’, which 
	was the default password output of the john crack_file which reveals the password.</h7><br><br>
