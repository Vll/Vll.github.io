<h2>Wireshark and TcpDump 101</h2>
	      
              <h7>WireShark and tcpdump are programs used to sniff(copy) and anaylze network traffic. They are both open source
		  (free) and comes standard with Kali Linux. However, neither is a point and click application. All tcpdump 
		  commands must be run through the command prompt.<br><br></h7>
	      
              <img src="/pen-test-basics/tcp01.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>By using the tcpdump command "tcpdump -v -w /root/Documents" tcpdump begins to capture and write a tcp packet capture scan to the file, "/root/Documents," 
		      with the name of the file tcp0. With the packet capture now active, I opened Firefox Mozilla, then opened the homepage to https://google.com and then 
		      searched for something simple, the term 'deer.' </h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/pen-test-basics/tcp02.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>After intializing the search and then waiting a few minutes for the page to load, I ended the capture. Because this is for demonstration purposes, there 
		      is no need to capture more data, because the size of the capture file is determined by the amount of time the data is being captured.
		      Using the ctrl+C command, tcpdump then prints a message identifying the amount of packets captured(1282) and dropped(50). 
</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/pen-test-basics/tcp03.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>In order to view the captured packet information in tcpdump, the command 'tcpdump -r' was used to read the file, at 
		      the location where it was dumped, /root/Documents/tcp0. The -v variable is supposed to give us the header of the 
		      packet data. The initial four sets of numbers preceding each data packet indicates the time stamp of each packet. 
		      Following that, is the source IP(kali:50305) and the destination IP. Next is the checksum status, which varies for 
		      each packet, and then everything else is related to the DNS application response. <br><br>
	      Though there is useful information that can be gleemed from viewing the packet capture in tcpdump, it's even more benifical to 
		      use Wireshark. In order to do so, the capture interface eth0 was selected with the capture filter setting, ‘not 
		      broadcast and not multicast’ selected. In wireshark, each packet’s information can be viewed in one of three windows. 
		      In the first window, each packet with source, destination and protocol information can be viewed.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/pen-test-basics/wire01.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>In the second pane has the details of each packet, mostly the protocols, port’s used, response times, 
		      and tcp analysis.  </h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/pen-test-basics/wire02.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>The bottom pane has the byte information of each packet. In the first packet, hex of the data’s source 
		      are visible, as any encryption/decryption information.  </h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/pen-test-basics/wire03.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>The point of this demonstration was to illustrate how network packet data can be captured with tcpdump and 
	      better analzed with Wireshark. These tools can be used individually, but work better in conjunction. </h7><br><br>
