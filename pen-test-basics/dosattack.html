<h2>Capturing a DoS Attack 101</h2>
	      
              <h7>To demonstrate a DoS attack, Metasploit server was launched to be 
		      the victim on a separate virtualbox machine at local IP 192.168.0.26. 
		      Simultaneously, using Kali Linux, Wireshark was launched on a Kali virtualbox, which was 
		      used to launch the attack, which can be seen as the eth0 network traffic at IP 192.168.0.25.</h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos01.png"><br><br>
              <h7>As shown above, hping3 launched a flood attack, which lasted for around 
		      twenty seconds and transmitted 35803 packets. Attacks like this can last for hours, so it's easy to imagine
		      the amount of data sent, in order to obstruct the network.</h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos02.png"><br><br>
              <h7>Wireshark captured the attack on the Metasploit server starting at packet 113. The first reply 
		      from the Metasploit server happens at packet 129, after 17 ping requests are sent from 
		      the attacking machine.</h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos03.png"><br><br>
              <h7>After 20 seconds, packet capture 14421 is recorded. It’s likely 
		      Metasploit was paralyzed through the duration of the attack.</h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos04.png"><br><br>
              <h7>The Half-Open attack is also done with hping3. The same virtual machines were used, using 
		      the same IP addresses.</h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos05.png"><br><br>
              <h7>During the half-open attack, hping3 outputs some basic packet attack information.<br><br></h7>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos06.png"><br><br>
              <h7>After ten seconds, the attack is ended. In this attack only 11 packets were transmitted in total. The 
		      wireshark output of the same attack reveals a few things. The first packet arrives as packet 90.</h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos07.png"><br><br>
              <h7>This first packet is a SYN packet. Normally this is used to intialize a tcp connection, however an hping attack
		      is just a constant stream of SYN packets with no expectation of returning ACK packets.</h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos08.png"><br><br>
              <h7>Though the attack continues with the same packet, it attacks a different port. The first 
		      port attacked was 1264, this time it’s 1265.</h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos09.png"><br><br>
              <h7>The final SYN attack packet is sent as packet 125 to port 1274.</h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos10.png"><br><br>
              <h7></h7><br><br>
	            <img src="/pen-test-basics/Dos11.png"><br><br>
              <h7>The final packet returned from the victim host was RST/ACK. Because we received this return packet, we can 
		      determine that the three way handshake was interrupted and also that either the response would not get 
		      forwarded back the client or there was no service running on said port.</h7><br><br>
