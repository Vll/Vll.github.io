<h2>ICE 1.140</h2>
	      
<h7>Ice 1.140 is a penetration testing enviroment, purposely left with vulnerablites in order to teach younglings
	the basics of penetration testing. The De-ICE vulnerability suites were created to give security testers 
	a safe environment to test for security vulnerabilities. It is considered to be low lovel of difficulty 
	by those who designed it. I use Virtualbox, where I've installed this version of De-ICE, and Kali Linux in forensics mode, in order to test for 
	vulnerabilities, and used NAT network server to establish a connection. Virtual Box is a virtual machine used to
	"sandbox" or isolate your work enviroment from your actual computer.<br><br></h7>
	      
<img src="/sandbox/ICE00.png"><br><br>	
<h7>To find the IP address assigned to De-ICE I first ran a basic ifconfig to 
		      see which IP range had been assigned.
</h7><br></br>	      
<img src="/sandbox/ICE01.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Kali is using the 10.0.2.x range. So I then ran ‘netdiscover’ to look for other connections. We get 
		      four results, two of those are running Cadmus. I then ran nmap to see what services were running on them. 
		      The first yielded no results but the second showed various open ports.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE02.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>I did one more scan on those specific open ports to see if I had missed anything. The results gave me a general 
		      sense of what I was dealing with and I concluded that this was the correct server.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE03.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Next, to establish what was running on the server I ran dirb to find 
		      any databases running on the servers.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE04.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>We can see that a webserver is running and get a location for the forum page.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE04.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Using ncat it’s possible to see that http on port 80 is definitely open and should be accessible 
		      through a standard web browser.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE05.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>If we open the address of the webserver in the browser we get the webpage ‘Lazy Admin.’ 
		      This is the first thing accessible from the server.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE06.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>I wondered if it was hiding any information. I simple select all’d the pages 
		      content. There was hidden text, with the same color font as the background. Likely 
		      just clues or tips to solving the server.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE06.01.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Using nikto, I was able to see all the information about the web address.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE07.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>I then used wfuzz to brute force search the http of this address, and it revealed apart 
		      from the index.html but a forum as well.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE08.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>I then used wfuzz to search the https of the web server address. This revealed 
		      both a mail server and php server.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE09.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>I went to the forum first and tried to gain access.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE10.png"><br><br>
	      <h7> After looking through the various threads posted on the forum, one post 
		      had a log of an password which was accidentally posted as a user name.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE11.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>It was unclear which admin the password belonged to. After reading further 
		      through the log it appeared to belong to ‘mbrown.’</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE12.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>After attempting to log in with this user password name 
		      combo I was into the forum as the admin mbrown.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE13.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>After looking through his profile, I was able to gain access to 
		      his mail account located on the https webmail server.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE14.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>In his emails, he had received, one in particular that had the user and password for the php server.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE15.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>I logged into the php server with these new credentials to 
		      see what information I could find. </h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE16.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>I wasn’t sure what I was looking for at this point, but attempted to find out any useful information.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE17.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>I was able to find the account names and some encrypted password hash information.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE18.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Using the hash information, a google search revealed the password for rheadley to be ‘tum-ti-tum.’ I could now try to ftp 
		      into the server since the port was open and I had some password credential information.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE19.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Now I was successfully inside of the server through ftp. I was then able to access the file system directly.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE20.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>With ftp, I’m able to see all the files accessible by the administrator. </h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE21.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>After changing into the ftp directory, and then /incoming, I was able to find a file containing a backup of 
		      the webhost, which I then downloaded to my root directory.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE22.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>With no more available directories available to search through, I attempted to ssh 
		      into mbrown’s account with the root credentials.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE23.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Once successfully in, I was able to navigate to his primary directory which had a 
		      private rsa key. I downloaded the key and used chmod to make it readable.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE24.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>With his key, I was then able to access the entire system.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE25.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>From there I was able to ssh into another account 
		      which provided the aes-256 information.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE26.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Now that I had the AES encryption information, I unzipped the web host backup file and could use the encryption 
		      method to unlock and decipher the password and shadow information.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE27.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>After concatenating the password and shadow files, I ran them with John the ripper. I 
		      made the mistake of using the rockyou.txt list, rather than the darkc0de.lst as recommended. 
		      36 hours later revealed no password.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE28.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Then I tried using just the default John list. 48 hours later; still no password.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE29.png"><br><br>
	      <h7></h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE30.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Finally, I tracked down the darkc0de list, and used it with john to crack the password. It took only a few hours.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE31.png"><br><br>
	      <h7></h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE32.png"><br><br>
	      <h7></h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE33.png"><br><br>
	      <h7>Finally, I had complete access and was able to unlock the secret.jpg.</h7><br><br>
	      <img src="/sandbox/ICE34.png"><br><br>
	      <h7> This vulnerability suite was designed to prove that though organizations 
		      often believe security is good, it is in actuality penetrable. Not just through 
		      lax security methods, but careless communication practices as well, revealed that human 
		      beings careless behaviors are always an organizational vulnerability.
